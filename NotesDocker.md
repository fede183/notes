# The Docker Landscape
## Process Simplification
1. Application developers request resources from operations engineers.
2. Resources are provisioned and handed over to developers.
3. Developers script and tool their deployment.
4. Operations engineers and developers tweak the deployment repeatedly.
5. Additional application dependencies are discovered by developers.
6. Operations engineers work to install the additional requirements.
7. Loop over steps 4 through 6 n more times.
8. The application is deployed.
